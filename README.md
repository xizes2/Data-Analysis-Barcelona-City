# Coursera Final Project
 
## Introduction
I want to compare the 73 neighborhoods in Barcelona on 3 main subjects: variety of venues (using foursquare API), the rental prices of appartaments and the criminality index.
The main objective of this work is to provide the stakeholders with relevant information to decision making.

## Data
I´ll use 3 data sources:
The foursquare API
Appartment rental prices per neighborhood: https://www.bcn.cat/estadistica/castella/dades/timm/ipreus/habllo/a2020/tbarris2.htm
Criminality rates per borough: http://www.bcn.cat/estadistica/catala/dades/anuari/Anuari2020_AAFF.pdf

## Methodology
I´ll create the main dataframe using the sources indicated above. I´ll gather the information, clean and treat it several libraries sucha as: requests, geopy, pandas, bs4. To further explore and analyse I´ll use seaborn and matplotlib libraries. And to plot the information on the map I´ll use folium library.
